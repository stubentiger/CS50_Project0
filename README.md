Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The project is a small website about my lovely cats and their breed.

Files structure:
-> Home.html:
  It is a main page giving brief information about the cats along with their photos. The main page offers you to obtain more info about the breed. Cats' photos are clickable and by clicking you're redirected to Cassandra's or Ruby's page. An alternative way to view cats' pages is to navigate there via navigation bar.

-> About_breed.html
  It is a page dedicated to Siberian breed. You can navigate here via a button from the Home page or by clicking on the corresponding item in the navigation bar.

-> Cassandra.html
-> Ruby.html
-> Cats folder:
  contains photos and pictures.
