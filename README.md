#Was done within Harvard CS50 "Web Programming with Python and JavaScript".

It is a pet project aimed at demonstrating the usage of html and SCSS.

#description

The project is a small static website about my cats and their breed.

Files structure:
-> Home.html:
  It is the main page giving brief information about the cats along with their photos. The main page offers you to obtain more info about the breed via the button. An alternative way to view the breed page and cats' pages is to navigate there via the navigation bar.

-> About_breed.html
  It is a page dedicated to a Siberian breed. You can navigate here via a button from the Home page or by clicking on the corresponding item in the navigation bar.
  The info about the breed is taken from a third party website, and I've given the link to it in the footer.

-> Cassandra.html
  The page dedicated to one of my cat called Cassandra. The page contains brief info about her in a text and a table formats, and also the photos.
  You can visit any other page of the website via the navigation bar.

-> Ruby.html
  The page is dedicated to my another cat called Ruby. It has the same structure as Cassandra's page.
  You can also visit any other page of the website via the navigation bar.

-> "Cats" folder:
  Contains photos and pictures used for the website.

-> css_styles.css
  Contains all css rules for the website. Compiled from css_styles.scss.
